/*Given two non-empty arrays of integers,
 write a function that determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.
A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that arenâ€™t necessarily 
adjacent in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array.
 For instance, the numbers [1, 3, 4] form a subsequence of the array [1, 2, 3, 4], 
 and so do the numbers [2, 4]. 
 Note that a single number in the array and the array itself are both valid subsequences of the array. 
Sample Input: array = [ 5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10 ], sequence = [ 1, 6, -1, 10 ]
Sample Output: true */

        sequenceIndex++;
      }
